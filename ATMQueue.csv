Summary of Insights,,,
? The simulation shows how an M/M/1 queue behaves under load.
? The system had 100 customers arrive and complete service.
? Average arrival rate (?) was 0.7066 and service rate (?) was 1.4136.
? The server was busy 49.71% of the time.
? On average, 0.8506 customers were in the system.
? Average time a customer spent in the system was 1.2038 units.
? The system throughput is a good approximation of the arrival rate since all customers were served.
